# FairLens - Top 100 Action Plan

Use this as the final checklist before submission. The goal is not just to have a working app. The goal is to show a clear problem, measurable impact, Google AI usage, and a polished demo.

## Day 1: Run and Verify Locally

1. Get a Gemini API key from `https://aistudio.google.com`.
2. Start the backend:

```bash
cd backend
venv\Scripts\activate
set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
python app.py
```

3. Start the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

4. Upload `sample_hiring_data.csv`.
5. Confirm these screens work:
   - Overview
   - Feature Analysis
   - AI Fix Suggestions
   - Before vs After

## Day 2: Polish the Story

Your judging story should be:

1. AI decisions can silently reproduce historical discrimination.
2. FairLens makes bias visible for non-technical teams.
3. FairLens explains which features drive the unfairness.
4. Gemini turns the audit into concrete data, model, and process fixes.
5. Reweighing shows measurable improvement in seconds.

Use the sample result:

- Female selection rate: 64.2%
- Male selection rate: 85.5%
- Demographic parity difference before: 0.213
- Disparate impact before: 0.751
- Demographic parity after mitigation: about 0.101
- Disparate impact after mitigation: about 0.890

## Day 3: Deploy

### Backend on Render

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Create a Render web service.
3. Build command: `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
4. Start command: `cd backend && gunicorn app:app`
5. Add environment variable: `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
6. Copy the Render URL.

### Frontend on Vercel

1. Set `frontend/.env.production` to your Render backend URL.
2. Deploy the frontend folder on Vercel.
3. Test upload, suggestions, and mitigation on the live URL.

## Day 4: Record Demo Video

Use `DEMO_SCRIPT.md`. Keep it under 5 minutes.

Show this exact flow:

1. Open FairLens.
2. Upload `sample_hiring_data.csv`.
3. Show high bias in Overview.
4. Show Feature Analysis.
5. Click Gemini suggestions.
6. Apply the reweighing fix.
7. Show improved before/after metrics.

## Day 5: Build Deck and Submit

Make a 10-slide deck:

1. FairLens title and one-line value proposition.
2. Problem: biased automated decisions.
3. Target users: HR, banks, hospitals, NGOs, auditors.
4. Solution workflow: upload, detect, explain, fix, compare.
5. Live demo screenshots.
6. Architecture.
7. Google AI usage: Gemini suggestions.
8. Fairness metrics and sample impact.
9. SDG 10, SDG 8, SDG 16 impact.
10. Future scope: Google Cloud deployment, multi-language reports, audit logs, richer mitigations.
