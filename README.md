# Aequora - AI Bias Detection and Mitigation Platform

Built for Google Solution Challenge 2026, Problem Statement 4: Unbiased AI Decision.

Aequora helps teams audit decision datasets for bias, explain which features are driving unfair outcomes, and test mitigation before an AI system affects real people.

## Problem

AI systems now influence who gets shortlisted for jobs, approved for loans, or prioritized for services. If those systems learn from biased historical data, they can repeat and scale the same unfair patterns.

In India, this can show up in hiring datasets where gender, region, education background, or proxy variables quietly reduce opportunities for qualified candidates.

## Solution

Aequora gives non-experts a simple workflow:

1. Measure: upload a CSV dataset and get fairness metrics.
2. Flag: inspect group selection rates and model feature influence.
3. Fix: ask Gemini for actionable recommendations and apply a reweighing mitigation.
4. Compare: see before-versus-after fairness metrics.

## Key Features

- CSV upload with automatic sensitive-column and outcome-column detection.
- Demographic parity difference, disparate impact ratio, and equalized odds difference.
- Group selection-rate chart for clear storytelling.
- Model feature-importance view for explainability.
- Gemini-powered data, model, and process fix suggestions.
- Reweighing mitigation with before-versus-after comparison.
- Sample hiring dataset included for instant testing.

## Sample Result

Using `sample_hiring_data.csv`, Aequora detects:

- Female selection rate: 64.2%
- Male selection rate: 85.5%
- Demographic parity difference: 0.213
- Disparate impact ratio: 0.751

After the reweighing mitigation, the model fairness improves:

- Demographic parity difference: 0.101
- Disparate impact ratio: 0.890
- Equalized odds difference: 0.140

## SDG Alignment

| SDG | Impact |
| --- | --- |
| SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities | Detects and reduces unfair outcomes across demographic groups. |
| SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth | Supports fairer hiring and opportunity access. |
| SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions | Promotes transparent, accountable automated decisions. |

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | React 18, Recharts, react-dropzone |
| Backend | Flask, Flask-CORS, pandas |
| Fairness and ML | Fairlearn, scikit-learn |
| AI Suggestions | Google Gemini API |
| Deployment | Vercel frontend, Google Cloud Run backend |

## Architecture

```text
CSV upload
  -> React frontend
  -> Flask API
  -> pandas validation
  -> Fairlearn metrics
  -> model feature explanation
  -> Gemini fix suggestions
  -> Dashboard and before/after comparison
```

## Local Setup

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
python app.py
```

The API runs at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Gemini Setup

To enable live AI recommendations:

1. Open [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)
2. Create a Gemini API key
3. Set it before starting the backend

Recommended local setup: create `D:\fairlens\backend\.env` with your Gemini key.

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Then restart the backend.

Windows CMD:

```bat
cd backend
venv\Scripts\activate
set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
python app.py
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
cd backend
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
python app.py
```

If no Gemini key is set, Aequora still works and returns offline fallback recommendations.

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | GET | Health check |
| `/columns` | POST | Detect columns and preview sample rows |
| `/analyze` | POST | Upload CSV and return fairness analysis |
| `/suggest` | POST | Get Gemini fix suggestions |
| `/fix` | POST | Apply mitigation and return improved metrics |
| `/chat` | POST | Ask the Aequora assistant about the current audit |
| `/repair` | POST | Repair a dataset and return a downloadable cleaned CSV |

## Deployment

Recommended stack for submission:

- Frontend: Vercel
- Backend: Google Cloud Run
- AI: Gemini API

### Deploy Backend To Google Cloud Run

The backend already includes a production `Dockerfile` for Cloud Run.

```powershell
cd backend
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID
gcloud run deploy aequora-api --source . --region asia-south1 --allow-unauthenticated --set-env-vars GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

After deploy, copy the Cloud Run service URL.

### Deploy Frontend To Vercel

Set `REACT_APP_API_URL` in Vercel to your Cloud Run backend URL, then deploy the `frontend` folder.

Example:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://aequora-api-xxxxx-uc.a.run.app
```

For local reference files, see [backend/.env.example](D:/fairlens/backend/.env.example:1), [frontend/.env.example](D:/fairlens/frontend/.env.example:1), and [frontend/.env.production.example](D:/fairlens/frontend/.env.production.example:1).

### Why This Stack Fits Solution Challenge

- Gemini API gives you a clear Google AI integration story.
- Cloud Run gives you a clear Google Cloud deployment story.
- Vercel is fine as an additional non-Google hosting tool because the project still uses Google technology directly.

## Submission Assets

- Prototype: deployed React app URL
- GitHub: public repository
- Demo video: under 5 minutes, showing upload, analysis, Gemini suggestions, and before/after comparison
- Project deck: problem, solution, architecture, SDG impact, demo screenshots, future scope

## Final Checklist

- The frontend opens and uploads CSV files correctly
- The backend returns `/columns`, `/analyze`, `/suggest`, and `/fix` responses
- The selected group column and outcome column are different
- The group column is not an identifier field such as `id`, `email`, or `phone`
- The outcome column contains at least two classes
- Gemini is configured and tested for live AI suggestions
- The deployed prototype link works on another device or browser
